Listing of cafe's I have tried out, when working remotely. Criteria is purely based on how conducive they were for doing productive work :)
> - No food ratings, as I do not think I would be a good judge
> - Not limited to WiFi cafes as my work laptop has 4G internet. I did not use WiFi in these cafes

| Cafe | Location | Seating | Ambient Noise | Service |
|:-----|:---------|:--------|:--------------|:--------|
| Rex | The Well, Camberwell | Ample private and common seating, tables and chairs | Moderate as in shopping centre, no loud music playing if seating in common area | Did not feel rushed by staff, food drinks served promptly |
